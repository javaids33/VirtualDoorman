# Flask GPIO Button Release API (Raspberry Pi)

This project provides a simple Flask-based web API that allows you to simulate a button release on your Raspberry Pi by shorting two GPIO-connected wires (e.g., green and red from an RJ9 cable).

## ðŸš€ Features
- Trigger a GPIO output to short two pins (simulate a button press/release).
- Lightweight Flask API with a `/release` endpoint.
- Easily accessible over your network.
